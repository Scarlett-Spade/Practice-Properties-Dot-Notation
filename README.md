# PROPERTIES & DOT NOTATION

This is a [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) course challenge; https://ev8c5.csb.app/.

# INSTRUCTIONS

Fork and rename the starter code(opens in a new tab).

Create a new variable called learning and assign it an empty object.

Create a property of your learning object called topic with a value of "JS".

Create another object property named learningGoals and assign it an array that contains four learning goals as elements, like “Build JS Programs.” You can choose any learning goal related to coding!

Create an object property called category with a value of "Front End Development".

Create another object property called topicImportance and give it a value of "High".

Log out the learning object in the console to check for the four properties.
Change & Remove Values

After console.log(), change the value of the topic property to “JavaScript”.

On the next line, remove the second item from the learningGoals property array. Hint: Use splice()!

Log out the learning object to make sure your changes worked.

Display Text & Remove a Class

Use the innerText property to set the value of the topicElement variable (see the top of the script.js file) to the string: “I’m learning <topic>.” Substitute <topic> for the value of the topic property using template literals and dot notation.
  
Remove the class “hide” that’s given to the topicElement. Reload the browser window to see the changes.
  
Set the innerText of the countElement to the string “I have <number> learning goals.” Substitute <number> with the length of the learningGoals property array.
  
Remove the class “hide” that’s given to countElement. Reload the browser window to see the changes.
